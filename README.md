# MessageBoardProject
**By Frederico Zile and Noemia Sambo**

The goal of this project is to create a simple website that mimics a message
board
• Users can visualise all the messages posted by users and post new messages
• The website provides two pages:
• Home page: the entry point of the website where the list of all the messages
are displayed
• Add message page: users can reach this page through a button in the
home page. This page shows a form that allows users to post message
